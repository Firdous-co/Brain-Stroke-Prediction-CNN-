# Brain Stroke Prediction Model (CNN)

## 📌 Overview
The **Brain Stroke Prediction Model** leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to analyze medical images and predict the likelihood of a stroke. This project is designed to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and risk assessment, improving patient outcomes.

## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Image Analysis**: Uses **CNN** for feature extraction and classification.
- **Medical Image Processing**: Preprocessing of brain scans using **OpenCV (cv2)**.
- **Automated Prediction**: Provides insights into potential stroke occurrences.
- **Scalable & Adaptable**: Can be expanded with more training data for improved accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV (cv2)
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Evaluation**: Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
- Brain MRI scan images from publicly available medical datasets.
- Preprocessed images (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization) before feeding into the CNN model.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load brain scan images.
   - Convert to grayscale and normalize pixel values.
   - Resize images to match CNN input requirements.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Design a **CNN architecture** suitable for stroke detection.
   - Train on preprocessed medical images.
3. **Evaluation & Prediction**:
   - Evaluate model accuracy using test data.
   - Predict stroke risk based on input scans.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## 📌 How to Run the Model
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python brain_stroke_prediction.py
   ```
3. **Input Brain MRI Image** and get prediction results.

## 🏆 Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with **transfer learning** (pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet).
- Implement a **web-based UI** for easy doctor access.
- Extend dataset for better generalization.
